###Getting an account

Email a request for a Beocat account to beocat@cis.ksu.edu. Include the following information:

###Log onto Beocat
Find and open your shell. 

On Macs the Terminal is in Applications/Utilities/Terminal. 


From your command prompt log on to Beocat by typing (enter your EID in the place of "EID"). Next type your password (the same one you use to log onto KSOL). When you type your password you will not see any text on the screen (this protects your privacy). 
 The first time you login you will be asked if you want to continue. Type "yes":


    ssh EID@beocat.cis.ksu.edu



On PCs download and install PuTTY. Here are more detailed instructions for logging on using PuTTY or the Terminal.
